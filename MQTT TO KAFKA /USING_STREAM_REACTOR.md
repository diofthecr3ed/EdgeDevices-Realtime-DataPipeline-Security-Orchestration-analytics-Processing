1. **Clone the Stream Reactor Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/lensesio/stream-reactor.git
   ```

2. **Build the Connectors:**
    ```
    Follow the instruction on the Repository to build the stream-reactor.
    ```

3. **Use the Connector JARs:**
   - Copy the desired connector JARs to the `libs` directory of your Kafka Connect installation.
   - Edit the Kafka Connect worker's configuration file (e.g., `connect-distributed.properties`).
   - Add the following line to the configuration file to specify the path to the directory containing the connector JARs:
     ```
     plugin.path=/path/to/connector/libs
     ```
   - Restart the Kafka Connect worker for the changes to take effect.

4. **Configure the Connectors:**
   - Each connector has its own configuration options. Refer to the specific connector documentation for details on how to configure it.
   - Configuration can typically be done via a JSON file or by using the Kafka Connect REST API.

5. **Start the Connectors:**
   - Use the Kafka Connect REST API or the Confluent Control Center to start the connectors.
   - Alternatively, you can start the connectors using the Kafka Connect CLI:
     ```
     bin/connect-standalone.sh config/connect-standalone.properties path/to/connector/config.properties
     ```

7. **Monitor the Connectors:**
   - Monitor the connectors using the Kafka Connect REST API, the Confluent Control Center, or the Kafka Connect CLI.
   - Check the connector logs for any errors or warnings.
